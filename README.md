# Aricks Dot Files

This repo is where I store all of my config files for various tools I use on Linux computers. Its pretty basic, but its just for me to keep stuff around for myself


# Usage
Run the ".config" file in this repo to install all the stuff you need for vim and tmux, and then just replace .tmux.conf and .vimrc in your base directory and install the plugins.
Everything should work after that.
